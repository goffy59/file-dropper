Perfect. Thanks for the deep dive—this thing deserves a proper write-up, and you’ve earned it. Here's a cleaned-up, accurate, no-BS description of **file-dropper**, shaped by exactly what you've got going on:

---

## 🗂️ file-dropper

**A lightweight, Dockerized web app for dropping files into a local or private system with zero cloud nonsense.**

file-dropper is a self-hostable file upload portal built with Flask and served via Gunicorn. It runs inside a Docker container and provides a dead-simple way to send files to a machine through the browser—ideal for trusted environments, airgapped boxes, or quick'n'dirty LAN setups.

---

### 🔧 What it does

- 📤 Web-based uploads (max size configurable)
- 💾 Files are saved directly to disk in a local `uploads/` folder
- 🖼️ Dynamically generated favicon for flair (hello dragon eye)
- 📝 HTML template with clean list of downloadable files
- 🐳 Dockerfile included for quick builds and sane production setup
- 🧰 Uses Gunicorn in multi-worker mode for production-ready serving

---

### 💡 Use cases

- Quick file transfers to your personal rig, server, VM, or container
- Sharing files between systems without fiddling with SSH or Samba
- Admins dropping configs, scripts, logs across a private network
- VM escape hatch: send files into guest systems during test/dev

---

### ⚠️ Heads-up

file-dropper is **not security-hardened** and **not intended for public internet exposure**. It's designed for trusted local networks, homelabs, or temporary internal use. If you're gonna expose it outside, **you’ll need to layer your own access controls, HTTPS, rate limiting, etc.**

---

### 🔍 Tech stack

- Python 3.9 (Alpine)
- Flask + Gunicorn
- Flask-HTTPAuth for basic auth
- Pillow for dynamic favicon generation
- Docker multi-stage build for clean layering

---

### 🏁 Getting started

```bash
docker build -t file-dropper .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd)/uploads:/app/uploads file-dropper
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and start dropping files.

Let me know if you have any questions. Happy home-labbing in the fascist dystopian future. Delete the cloud and embrace self hosting.
